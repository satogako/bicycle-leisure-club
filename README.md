## Testing
---
* I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera.

* I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the
    devtools device toolbar.

* I confirmed that the navigation, header, about club, about rent bicycles, sign up, and opening time are all readable and easy to
    understand.

* I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field,
    and the submit button works.


### Mistakes


* Fixed bugs

    - Before deploying the project to Git Hub, I found that the Sign up link only worked on one page.

    - Checked that I was using the same #signup-form identifier in all the HTML files for the link.
        ```
        <li>
        <a href="#signup-form">Sign Up</a>
        </li>
        ```
     - I solved the problem by providing Sign up on each page with a separate identifier from the footer section.



### Validator Testing

* HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

* CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator

* Accessibility
    - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse
